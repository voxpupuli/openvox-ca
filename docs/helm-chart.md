# Deploying with Helm

The `openvox-ca` Helm chart deploys the CA on Kubernetes. It is maintained in
this repository under [`charts/openvox-ca`](../charts/openvox-ca) and released
in lockstep with the server: the chart's `version` and `appVersion` are always
the release version, so chart `0.9.0` deploys openvox-ca `0.9.0` and defaults
to that release's image.

This is the narrative guide. The exhaustive values table is the
[chart's own README](../charts/openvox-ca/README.md); the settings you place in
`config` are documented in [configuring the server](configuration.md).

## Installing

The chart is distributed as an **OCI artefact only** — there is no HTTP chart
repository and no `helm repo add` step. The commands below omit `--version`, so
helm resolves the newest published chart; add `--version X.Y.Z` to pin one (the
chart version is the openvox-ca version):

```console
$ helm install openvox-ca \
    oci://ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca \
    --namespace puppet --create-namespace \
    --values my-values.yaml
```

Inspect it before installing:

```console
$ helm show values oci://ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca
$ helm template openvox-ca oci://ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca \
    --values my-values.yaml
```

The chart lives in a GHCR package of its own, separate from the container
images, because one package cannot hold both:

| Artefact | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Container images | `ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca` |
| Helm chart | `ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca` |

Alongside each release, every push to `main` republishes a **rolling
development chart** at the in-development version (e.g. `0.9.0-dev`). That tag
is mutable — each push overwrites it — and its `appVersion` resolves to the
rolling `edge-alpine` image, so the two stay consistent. Use it to try
unreleased changes; never pin production to it.

## Verifying the chart

The chart is signed and carries SLSA v1.0 build provenance, like the images.
Pin the identity to the release shape rather than accepting anything this
repository signed:

```console
$ cosign verify ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca:X.Y.Z \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/voxpupuli/openvox-ca/\.github/workflows/helm-chart\.yml@refs/tags/v'
```

The rolling development chart is signed too, but from `main` rather than from a
tag, so its certificate identity ends `@refs/heads/main` and the pattern above
will not match it. Substitute that suffix if you are deliberately verifying a
development chart.

There is no `.prov` file, so `helm verify` has nothing to check — Helm's own
provenance mechanism is PGP and wants a long-lived keyring, which is what
Sigstore's short-lived certificates exist to avoid. The chart carries no SBOM
either: it declares no dependencies, so there would be nothing to catalogue. The
software it installs is the container image, which carries its own — see
[verifying an image](container-images.md#verifying-an-image).

## How the chart is configured

openvox-ca has a large configuration surface, and the chart deliberately does
**not** mirror it key by key. Instead:

- **`config`** is written verbatim to `/etc/puppet-ca/config.yaml`, which the
  server auto-detects and the chart passes explicitly via `--config`. Every key
  in [configuring the server](configuration.md) is valid there, including the
  nested `kubernetes_export` and `openbao` blocks.
- **Convenience blocks** — `tls`, `ca`, `caKeyPassphrase`, `puppetServers`,
  `autosign`, `metrics`, `kubernetesExport`, `persistence` — do the Kubernetes
  half of a feature (mount the Secret, open the port, create the RBAC) *and*
  set the config keys pointing at whatever they mounted.
- **`config` always wins**, with three exceptions. The two are deep-merged with
  your `config` on top — except `port`, `cadir` and `metrics_listen`, which also
  shape a Kubernetes object (the container port and Service, the volume mount,
  the exporter's port and any ServiceMonitor). Overriding one of those in `config`
  alone would move the server and leave the object behind, so the chart refuses
  the install and names the value to set instead.
  This is why `verbosity` is written into the config file rather than passed as
  `--verbosity`: a flag would outrank the file unconditionally, leaving
  `config.verbosity` silently ineffective. The only argument the chart passes is
  `--config`.

So this:

```yaml
tls:
  existingSecret: openvox-ca-tls
```

mounts that Secret read-only and produces `tls_cert: /run/secrets/openvox-ca-tls/tls.crt`
and the matching `tls_key`. If you would rather point them somewhere else, set
`config.tls_cert` and `config.tls_key` and they take precedence.

Run `helm template` to see exactly what the merge produced — the rendered
`config.yaml` is right there in the ConfigMap.

Settings that must come from a Secret at runtime, such as a database DSN, go
through the environment instead:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: openvox-ca-db
        key: password
  - name: PUPPET_CA_SQL_DSN
    value: postgres://openvox-ca:$(POSTGRES_PASSWORD)@db-rw:5432/openvox-ca?sslmode=require
```

Environment variables take precedence over the config file, which is what makes
this work.

## Choosing an image

The chart defaults to the **Alpine** image variant. With `image.tag` empty it
resolves to `<appVersion>-alpine`, e.g. `ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca:0.9.0-alpine`.

An explicit tag is used verbatim — the chart never appends a suffix to it — so
the CentOS Stream variant, whose tags carry no suffix, is simply:

```yaml
image:
  tag: "0.9.0"
```

To pin by digest (which is what you want if you are reconciling with Flux or
Argo CD and letting an image automation update it):

```yaml
image:
  digest: sha256:78f5a09763…
```

The digest wins over the tag, and the reference becomes
`repository@sha256:…`.

## TLS: the chart's most important setting

Puppet agents speak HTTPS, and openvox-ca authenticates administrative
operations by **client certificate**. Serving plain HTTP on a non-loopback
address would let an on-path host inject forged certificates, so the server
does not offer it as a fallback: it **refuses to start**.

The chart therefore refuses to render an install that would hit that, rather
than handing you a pod that crash-loops. `helm install` with no TLS
configuration fails immediately, naming the ways out. The usual one is to point
`tls.existingSecret` at a `kubernetes.io/tls` Secret — cert-manager produces one
readily:

```yaml
tls:
  existingSecret: openvox-ca-server-tls
```

The alternatives, in the same message:

| Setting | When |
| --- | --- |
| `config.tls_cert` / `config.tls_key` | A certificate you mount yourself, via `extraVolumes` |
| `env` / `extraEnv` — `PUPPET_CA_TLS_CERT` and `PUPPET_CA_TLS_KEY` | The paths come from a Secret at runtime. Environment variables outrank the config file, and the chart counts them |
| `config.no_tls_required: true` | Only behind a proxy that terminates TLS and re-originates it to the pod. Client certificates do not survive that, so mTLS-authenticated endpoints become unreachable |
| `listen.host: 127.0.0.1` or `localhost` | A sidecar-only deployment. Those two spellings and nothing else: the server tests `net.ParseIP(host).IsLoopback()`, which rejects the bracketed `[::1]`, and it builds its listen address as `host + ":" + port`, which turns a bare `::1` into the unparseable `::1:8140` |

With `no_tls_required` the chart also switches the health probes to HTTP, since
the kubelet has to speak whatever the server speaks. Set `httpGet.scheme` on a
probe explicitly to override that.

**The check only runs when the chart can see the whole configuration.**
`existingConfigMap`, `args`, `envFrom` and a `--config` in `extraArgs` each put
settings somewhere the chart does not read — someone else's ConfigMap, a replaced
argv, a Secret, a config file it never rendered — so it stops asserting rather
than refusing an install it cannot judge. In those modes
the probes assume HTTPS, and it is on you to set `httpGet.scheme` if the server
is actually serving cleartext.

**A renewed certificate needs a signal or a restart — nothing sends one.**
openvox-ca re-reads the keypair on `SIGHUP` and serves it to new handshakes
without dropping connections in flight (see
[reloading configuration](configuration.md#reloading-configuration)), and the
chart mounts `tls.existingSecret` as an ordinary Secret volume with no
`subPath`, so the kubelet refreshes the files in place when cert-manager rotates
them. What nothing does is signal the pod, so the running process keeps serving
the old certificate until something acts. The probes talk to that same listener,
so readiness stays green right up to expiry, at which point every agent fails at
once.

Three ways to act, cheapest first:

- `kubectl exec <pod> -- kill -HUP 1` — PID 1 is the supervisor, which forwards
  the signal to the frontend. No restart, no dropped connections.
- `kubectl rollout restart deployment/<release>-openvox-ca`.
- Let a controller restart it: `ci/postgres-ha-values.yaml` sets
  `reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"` under `podAnnotations`, which has
  [Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) watch every Secret and
  ConfigMap the pod mounts. Note that Reloader restarts the pod; neither it nor
  the chart sends `SIGHUP`.

Two further consequences follow from the CA terminating its own TLS:

- **Ingress must pass TLS through**, not terminate it (see below).
- **The pod's `fsGroup` must match its `runAsGroup`.** Mounted Secrets are
  written mode `0600` owned by `root:fsGroup`; the kubelet grants group access
  when `fsGroup` is set, which is how the container user reads them. The chart's
  default `podSecurityContext` already does this — if you replace it wholesale,
  keep `fsGroup` aligned with `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`.

## Storage and replicas

The default is the **filesystem** backend on a PersistentVolumeClaim. That is
the simplest correct deployment, and the one restriction is that it does not
scale out: the CA's private key and inventory live on that volume.

```yaml
persistence:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: fast-ssd
  size: 2Gi
```

The PVC carries `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so `helm uninstall` does not
take the CA's private key with it. Set `persistence.retain: false` if you
genuinely want it removed with the release.

To run more than one replica, move the state into a shared backend — see
[storage backends](storage-backends.md) — and turn persistence off, because
`cadir` then holds nothing durable. Worth knowing before you scale out: a
revocation reaches the other replicas within `crl_sync_interval_sec` (60s by
default) rather than instantly, since each answers revocation checks from its own
copy of the CRL — see
[revocation across replicas](configuration.md#revocation-across-replicas).
A certificate signed on one replica is likewise reported `unknown` by the
others until they reload the inventory into the index their OCSP responder
answers from, within `ocsp_index_sync_interval_sec` (5m by default) — see
[OCSP status across replicas](configuration.md#ocsp-status-across-replicas).

```yaml
replicaCount: 2

persistence:
  enabled: false
emptyDir:
  medium: Memory

strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 1

config:
  storage_backend: postgres
```

The `strategy` block above is redundant, and shown only to be explicit: an
unset `strategy` already follows `persistence.enabled`, so turning persistence
off selects RollingUpdate on its own. Recreate applies while the cadir is a
ReadWriteOnce PVC that a surging replacement pod could not mount; once the
state is external there is nothing left to serialise on. `podDisruptionBudget` and
`autoscaling` become meaningful at that point too.

### Sizing

The default memory limit is 64Mi, and it is a hard cap. The server's footprint
grows with the size of the fleet: it keeps a serial index and a cache of
pre-signed OCSP responses, one entry per known certificate, pruned only on
revocation or expired-certificate cleanup. Crossing the limit is an OOMKill, and
with the Recreate strategy that persistence-enabled installs default to, that
is CA downtime. Raise
`resources.limits.memory` before a growing inventory reaches it, and consider
setting `GOMEMLIMIT` just under it through `env` so the Go runtime collects
harder instead of hitting the cgroup wall:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 256Mi
env:
  GOMEMLIMIT: 240MiB
```

With `persistence.enabled: false` and the default `emptyDir.medium: Memory`, the
cadir tmpfs counts against the same limit.

### Shutdown and drain

The 30-second default `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` nests the server's
25-second drain plus the supervisor's 3-second headroom. If you raise
`shutdown_timeout_sec`, raise the grace period to at least that plus three —
see [graceful shutdown](configuration.md#graceful-shutdown).

## Exposing the CA

### Service

```yaml
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 443
```

For dual stack, set both the Service policy and the listen address — a
dual-stack Service in front of a pod listening only on `0.0.0.0` gets you an
IPv6 address that refuses connections:

```yaml
service:
  ipFamilyPolicy: RequireDualStack

listen:
  host: "[::]"

metrics:
  host: "[::]"
```

`ipFamilies` pins the families and their order (the first is primary), so
`[IPv6, IPv4]` gives an IPv6-primary Service. Leave both unset to inherit the
cluster default.

### Ingress

**The controller must pass TLS through.** A controller that terminates TLS
strips the client certificate, and every administrative endpoint stops
authenticating.

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: haproxy
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
  hosts:
    - host: ca.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
```

The annotation is controller-specific: HAProxy uses
`ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough`, ingress-nginx uses
`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough` (and needs the controller started
with `--enable-ssl-passthrough`). Note that `ingress.tls` is *not* how you
serve TLS here — the serving certificate openvox-ca presents does that, from
the `tls` Secret or from `config.tls_cert`/`config.tls_key`. Only set it if
your controller needs a certificate for SNI routing.

If you deliberately terminate TLS at the edge, set `config.no_tls_required:
true` and accept that mTLS-authenticated endpoints are unreachable.

### Gateway API

Use a **TLSRoute** — the Gateway API equivalent of ssl-passthrough. It forwards
the TLS connection without terminating it, so client certificates arrive
intact:

```yaml
gateway:
  tlsRoute:
    enabled: true
    parentRefs:
      - name: external
        namespace: gateway-system
        sectionName: tls-passthrough
    hostnames:
      - ca.example.com
```

The Gateway listener it attaches to needs `tls.mode: Passthrough`. TLSRoute is
in the Gateway API **experimental** channel (`v1alpha2`), so the CRD must be
installed from that channel; `gateway.tlsRoute.apiVersion` is available if your
implementation serves it elsewhere.

An **HTTPRoute** (`gateway.httpRoute`) is also available, but it makes the
Gateway terminate TLS. Reserve it for the anonymous endpoints — CRL
distribution, OCSP, health — where no client certificate is involved:

```yaml
gateway:
  httpRoute:
    enabled: true
    parentRefs:
      - name: internal
        namespace: gateway-system
    hostnames:
      - crl.example.com
    rules:
      - matches:
          - path:
              type: PathPrefix
              value: /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_revocation_list
        backendRefs:
          - name: openvox-ca
            port: 443
```

Both may be enabled at once if you want passthrough for agents and a plain-HTTP
CRL endpoint for verifiers.

## Admin access

Compilers that need to sign, revoke, or list certificates must be named:

```yaml
puppetServers:
  - openvoxserver.example.com
  - compile-1.example.com
```

The chart renders these into the config ConfigMap and sets
`puppet_server_file`. Without them no CN has admin access, and the chart says
so on install.

By default a client certificate carrying the `pp_cli_auth` extension is also
accepted as an admin credential. Set `config.no_pp_cli_auth: true` to require
the CN allow list alone.

## Autosigning

Off by default, which is the right default: autosigning lets any CSR submitter
obtain a signed certificate without operator review.

A glob allowlist is rendered into the config ConfigMap for you:

```yaml
autosign:
  patterns:
    - "*.agent.example.com"
    - "compile-*.internal"
```

`autosign.mode` takes the raw setting instead — `"true"` (sign everything;
development only, and the chart warns), or a path to an executable policy
plugin you have mounted via `extraVolumes`.

## Monitoring

The Prometheus exporter is off by default. Enabling it opens a second,
plain-HTTP listener and adds the port to the pod and the Service:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    labels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
```

The `ServiceMonitor` is opt-in on top of that, because it needs the Prometheus
Operator CRDs; the chart refuses the combination of a ServiceMonitor with the
exporter disabled rather than creating a monitor for a port that does not
exist. Its `labels` usually need whatever label your Prometheus selects
monitors on.

**Leaf-certificate metrics carry node hostnames as label values.** Restrict who
can scrape them:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  metricsNamespaces:
    - monitoring
```

A [Jsonnet alerting mixin](../mixin/) ships with the project for the expiry and
export-failure alerts. Its selector is a fixed `job="openvox-ca"`, and the
chart leaves `metrics.serviceMonitor.jobLabel` empty so the Prometheus Operator
derives `job` from the Service name.

Those two only line up when the Service is named `openvox-ca`. **Set the
mixin's `puppetCASelector` to match your deployment** rather than reaching for
`jobLabel` to force the job name: `job` has to stay distinct per release,
because two releases of this chart may run side by side while a fleet migrates
from one CA to another, and an alert that cannot say which one is failing is
worth little. Pointing `jobLabel` at `app.kubernetes.io/name` in particular
would give every release of the chart the same job, since that label carries the
chart name rather than the release name.

## Network policy

Disabled by default. When enabled, the API port admits the whole cluster —
Puppet agents live in any namespace — and the metrics port only the namespaces
you list:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  apiAccess: any          # or "namespace", or "none" to define it yourself
  metricsNamespaces:
    - monitoring
  egress:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - to:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                cnpg.io/cluster: openvox-ca-cnpg
        ports:
          - port: 5432
            protocol: TCP
```

Turning egress on means you must enumerate everything **the pod** talks to. DNS
is always allowed; everything else is yours to list. Two things about that are
easy to get wrong:

- **The policy governs the whole pod, not the server container.** A
  `NetworkPolicy` selects pods, so every `initContainers` and `extraContainers`
  entry you add is bound by the same rules. A sidecar that fetches something
  over the network — an upstream CRL chain is the common case, see [trust and
  revocation across CAs](#trust-and-revocation-across-cas) — needs its own
  destination listed, or it fails with a timeout and no file, which several of
  these features read as "nothing to say" rather than as an error.
- **OpenBao's Kubernetes auth needs no egress to the Kubernetes API.** The pod
  presents its own projected ServiceAccount token, which it reads from a mounted
  file, and OpenBao performs the `TokenReview` itself — so the API server is
  OpenBao's peer here, not the CA's. Egress to the API is needed for
  [Kubernetes export](#kubernetes-export), which really does call it. Listing it
  unconditionally opens a hole the deployment does not use.

So the list is: your storage backend, OpenBao if the key lives there, anything
your sidecars fetch, and the Kubernetes API only if you export.

## Kubernetes export

Publishing the CA certificate and CRL into Secrets and ConfigMaps for other
workloads (see [Kubernetes export](kubernetes-export.md)) needs three things,
all of which the chart handles from one block: the config, the RBAC, and a
mounted ServiceAccount token.

```yaml
kubernetesExport:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    - kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: openvox-ca-trust
      cert: true
      crl: true
    - kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: openvox-ca-crl
        namespace: monitoring
      crl: true
      crl_key: ca_crl.pem
  rbac:
    namespaces:
      - monitoring
```

`rbac.namespaces` lists the *extra* namespaces to bind the Role into; the
release namespace is always included. Every namespace you export into needs a
binding. `rbac.scope: ClusterRole` grants it cluster-wide instead, which is
worth it only if you export into many namespaces.

The chart mounts the ServiceAccount token automatically when this (or OpenBao's
Kubernetes auth) is enabled, and leaves it unmounted otherwise. These are the
inputs it counts as enabled — some because it can see the setting, the rest
because it cannot see far enough to rule it out:

| Input | Why it mounts |
| --- | --- |
| `kubernetesExport.enabled`, or `config.kubernetes_export.targets` | Export is configured, so the exporter needs the API |
| `config.openbao.auth_method: kubernetes` | The key provider authenticates with the pod's own token |
| `PUPPET_CA_OPENBAO_AUTH_METHOD: kubernetes` in `env` or `extraEnv` | Environment variables outrank the config file, so the chart reads those two values too. An empty value is ignored, as the server ignores it |
| `--openbao-auth-method=kubernetes` in `extraArgs` | Arguments outrank both, and `extraArgs` is appended to the argv the chart builds, so it is readable |
| An `extraEnv` entry for that variable fed by `valueFrom` | The chart cannot read which method the Secret names, so it assumes the one needing a token |
| A bare `--openbao-auth-method` in `extraArgs`, with the value in the next element | The chart does not reassemble the separated form, so it assumes the same |
| `existingConfigMap`, `args` or `envFrom` | Each can configure either feature somewhere the chart does not read at all |
| A `--config` in `extraArgs` | The chart renders its own `--config` and appends `extraArgs` after it, so a second one wins and the server reads a file the chart never saw |

`automountServiceAccountToken` forces the decision either way.

## Running under an external root

openvox-ca can run as an intermediate CA under a parent root, using the offline
`openvox-ca csr` and `openvox-ca import-ca-cert` subcommands. No chart value
enables it.

**Follow [running under an external root CA](openbao-transit.md#running-under-an-external-root-ca).**
That is the canonical procedure — the flags, the ordering, the re-issuance case —
and despite living in the OpenBao guide it applies to every `ca_key_provider`,
including the default. It already covers Kubernetes: a one-shot Job carrying the
same ServiceAccount, image and mounts as the Deployment, and the three details
that are easy to get wrong there. Use it rather than improvising from this page.

What that guide cannot know is what this chart names things, and the rest of this
section is only that:

- **Substitute the chart's names into its Job.** Its example mounts
  `configMap: { name: openvox-ca-config }` and puts `cadir` at
  `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca`; the chart renders the ConfigMap, the
  ServiceAccount and the PVC all as `openvox-ca.fullname` — `<release>-openvox-ca`,
  or just `openvox-ca` when the release name already contains it — and takes
  `cadir` from `persistence.mountPath`, `/var/lib/puppet-ca` by default. The cadir
  one matters most: the Job reads the chart's own `config.yaml`, so a mount at the
  example's path leaves the command looking somewhere else and quietly reproducing
  the wrong CA rather than failing.
- **The server refuses to start between the two steps**, which under a Deployment
  is a crash-loop, so do not begin a rollout inside that window — see
  [the server will not start between steps 1 and 3](openbao-transit.md#the-server-will-not-start-between-steps-1-and-3).
  Scaling to zero is the obvious answer and is wrong under OpenBao Kubernetes auth,
  where the pod's own token is the credential; that guide's Job route exists for
  exactly this.
- **A restart is required, not a signal.** `SIGHUP` covers the TLS keypair and the
  admin allow list; the CA certificate is read at startup, so a signalled process
  carries on issuing under the certificate you just replaced.
- **Re-issuing later needs the CA stopped, on any backend.** The `--force`
  re-issuance is a read-modify-write across the certificate and the CRL, and it
  takes the bootstrap and CRL locks. Those are genuinely cross-process
  everywhere now — `filesystem` and `sqlite`, the chart's default, coordinate two
  processes on one host with `flock(2)` — so a revocation is no longer silently
  discarded, and the import will instead wait and then fail if the CA holds the
  lock. What no lock covers on any backend is the inventory append, so an import
  racing issuance can still leave the inventory's integrity value inconsistent.
  See [running a second process against a live
  store](storage-backends.md#running-a-second-process-against-a-live-store).
- **With `ca.existingSecret` the CA certificate is mounted read-only**, so the
  import cannot write it back. That is the `--out` route in the procedure, which
  cannot be combined with `--force`, and which ends in `openvox-ca-ctl
  reissue-crl` — an admin API call needing a client certificate whose CN is in
  `puppetServers`. The chart neither mounts one nor documents obtaining one, so
  plan that credential before you start.

Everything else about the resulting CA — storage, TLS, export — is unchanged; only
the certificate's issuer differs.

## Trust and revocation across CAs

Running under an external root brings two more features into scope, and the
chart models neither with a value of its own. Both are `config` plus a mount,
and they are documented together because a deployment under a shared root
usually wants both:

| Feature | Direction | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crl_chain_file` | **outbound** — published to agents | Serving the ancestors' CRLs alongside this CA's own, so agents on Puppet's default `certificate_revocation = chain` can complete the walk |
| `client_ca` | **inbound** — consulted by the authorisation middleware, never served | Authenticating clients that a *different* CA issued, typically a sibling intermediate under the same root |

Both are about CRLs and they point in opposite directions, which is what makes
them easy to confuse. The canonical
descriptions are [publishing an upstream CRL
chain](configuration.md#publishing-an-upstream-crl-chain) and [trusting client
certificates from another CA](configuration.md#trusting-client-certificates-from-another-ca);
read those for the semantics. This section is only what changes in Kubernetes.

Two chart facts apply to both:

- **`/etc/puppet-ca` is not yours to write into.** It is `configMount`, where
  the chart projects its rendered ConfigMap read-only. The standalone examples
  in [configuration.md](configuration.md) put these files there because that is
  the conventional config directory outside Kubernetes; under the chart you must
  give them a path of their own. `/run/secrets/...` is the idiom the chart
  already uses for `tls`, `ca` and the OpenBao credentials.
- **`extraConfigFiles` is the wrong escape hatch for either file.** It writes
  into that same ConfigMap, so the content would live in your values and refresh
  only on `helm upgrade` — and both of these files exist precisely to carry
  revocation data that must stay current between upgrades.

`crl_chain_file` can alternatively be fed in as `PUPPET_CA_CRL_CHAIN_FILE`
through `env` or `extraEnv`, as can `client_revocation_policy` and
`client_crl_refresh_interval_sec`. The `client_ca` list itself has no
environment encoding at all — it is a list of structures, file-only like
`kubernetes_export` — so it has to come through `config`.

### Publishing an upstream CRL chain

Before the mount, one decision that is not a chart decision at all: a CRL is
only published if a certificate in this CA's **stored bundle** signed it, so
publishing an ancestor's CRL means adding that ancestor to the bundle — and the
bundle is what `GET /certificate/ca` serves every agent. Make that choice with
[the bundle note in the operator CLI
guide](operator-cli.md#offline-subcommands-on-the-server-binary) in front of
you; it is the authoritative statement and it covers the case that catches
people, which is that ending the bundle at a root admits every sibling sub-CA
beneath it. Nothing about it changes under Helm.

Mount the bundle from its own volume and point `config.crl_chain_file` at it:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: upstream-crls
    secret:
      secretName: openvox-ca-upstream-crls
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: upstream-crls
    mountPath: /run/secrets/upstream-crls
    readOnly: true

config:
  crl_chain_file: /run/secrets/upstream-crls/upstream-crls.pem
```

Nothing in openvox-ca writes that Secret. Refresh it with whatever already
fetches your root's CRL — a CronJob, a config-management run, cert-manager — and
the `crl-chain-refresh` job picks the change up within
`crl_chain_refresh_interval_sec` (an hour by default).

**Turn it on in a separate `helm upgrade` from the one that bumps the chart.**
A Deployment rolls rather than recreates, so for the length of a rollout you
have old and new pods serving at once — and a replica running a build from
before chain preservation re-signs the CRL as a single block and silently drops
the chain, which one revocation in that window makes permanent for the whole
fleet. Upgrade first, let the rollout finish, then set `config.crl_chain_file`.
See [rolling upgrades](configuration.md#publishing-an-upstream-crl-chain).

You need not set `defaultMode`. With `fsGroup` in play the kubelet chowns a
projected volume to `root:fsGroup` and **ORs** a read mask into whatever mode is
there, so the container reads the file whether you set a restrictive mode or
leave the default alone — the same mechanism [the TLS section](#tls-the-charts-most-important-setting)
describes, and the one the chart's own `0600` key-material Secrets rely on.

Where that does bite is if you replace `podSecurityContext` wholesale and drop
`fsGroup`: the projection is then root-owned with no group access and the CA
cannot read it, which is the **present but unreadable** row of [what each
failure to read the file
does](configuration.md#what-each-failure-to-read-the-file-does) — the refresh
fails, and revocation is blocked with it. Keep `fsGroup` aligned with
`runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`, as that section already says.

#### Order the writer before the server

**Whatever populates the file must be ordered before the server starts**, not
merely started alongside it — see [order the writer before the
server](configuration.md#order-the-writer-before-the-server) for why the timer
does not rescue the window. A Secret that some other controller populates is
already subject to this: if it is not there at startup, the CA publishes its own
CRL alone and does not look again for an hour, and every agent on the default
`certificate_revocation = chain` rejects the CRL it is served for that whole
interval.

In Kubernetes the fix is a **native sidecar** — an `initContainer` with
`restartPolicy: Always` whose `startupProbe` gates the containers after it.

> **This shape needs Kubernetes 1.29 or newer.** `restartPolicy` on an init

> and accept that nothing keeps the file fresh between restarts.

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: upstream-crls
    emptyDir:
      medium: Memory       # a shared tmpfs; never touches the node's disk
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: upstream-crls
    mountPath: /run/crl-chain
    readOnly: true

initContainers:
  - name: fetch-upstream-crls
    image: curlimages/curl:8.11.1
    restartPolicy: Always          # native sidecar (Kubernetes 1.29+): starts before, runs alongside
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args:
      - |
        while true; do
          curl -sSf -o /run/crl-chain/.tmp https://pki.example.com/root.crl.pem \
            && mv /run/crl-chain/.tmp /run/crl-chain/upstream-crls.pem
          sleep 900
        done
    volumeMounts:
      - name: upstream-crls
        mountPath: /run/crl-chain
    startupProbe:
      exec:
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "test -s /run/crl-chain/upstream-crls.pem"]
      periodSeconds: 5
      failureThreshold: 60

config:
  crl_chain_file: /run/crl-chain/upstream-crls.pem
```

Four details in that carry the weight:

- **`test -s`, not `test -f`.** Probe for a *non-empty* file. A zero-byte file
  is a deliberate statement here — it means "publish nothing extra" — so a probe
  testing only for existence passes on exactly the case that drops every
  ancestor CRL, permanently, since this CA cannot re-sign another CA's list.
- **The `mv` is the point of the `curl`.** Write to a temporary path and rename,
  so a read never catches a partial write. A file not ending on a PEM block
  boundary is refused rather than acted on, and until the next complete write
  lands, revocation fails.
- **A `startupProbe` and no `readinessProbe`.** The startup probe is what gates
  the server; a readiness probe on the writer would be actively harmful, because
  a sidecar's readiness feeds the pod's, so a later fetch failure would take a
  perfectly healthy CA out of the Service. A stale chain is far better than no
  CA: the writer's job is to block the *first* start, not to keep voting on the
  pod's fitness afterwards.
- **`initContainers` runs through `tpl`**, so the image can reference `.Values`
  and the chart's helpers if you would rather not hard-code it.
  `extraVolumeMounts` does **not** — it is the one member of this group that is
  passed through as written.

If you have `networkPolicy.egress` enabled, the sidecar's own destination must
be listed in it. The policy binds the whole pod, and a blocked fetch leaves no
file at all — which this feature reads as "no statement" rather than as a
failure, so nothing goes red. See [network policy](#network-policy).

### Trusting client certificates from another CA

`client_ca` is the topology where the servers and operators administering this
CA hold certificates from a sibling intermediate rather than from this CA.
Without it they cannot authenticate at all. It is a mount plus an entry plus a
deliberate decision about authority, in that order.

**1. Choose the anchor: the issuing CA, not the root.** Take the certificate of
the intermediate that actually signs the client certificates. Anchoring on the
root above it silently extends this entry's authority — `admin_cns` included —
to every intermediate that root has issued or ever will, and under
`client_revocation_policy: require` it also [locks everyone
out](configuration.md#trusting-client-certificates-from-another-ca), because an
intermediate's own CRL is signed by that intermediate rather than by the root
and so is discarded. The server warns at startup on a self-signed anchor.

**2. Obtain that CA's CRL.** openvox-ca is handed a file; it never fetches a
distribution point. Read the CDP out of a certificate that CA issued —
`openssl x509 -noout -text -in client.pem | grep -A2 'CRL Distribution'` — and
fetch from there. A delta CRL or one scoped to an issuing distribution point
does not count as coverage, so fetch the full list.

**3. One entry per issuer.** `admin_cns` and `allow_pp_cli_auth` belong to the
*entry*, while its `file` may hold any number of anchors — so two issuers
bundled into one entry share one admin list, and a CN you meant for one is
honoured from the other. The server warns at startup when an entry that grants
anything has more than one anchor. Entries are cheap; give each issuer its own,
with its own `crl_file`.

**4. Put the anchor and the CRL in a Secret, and mount it.** Both files, one
volume, no `subPath` — `crl_file` is re-read on a timer exactly as
`crl_chain_file` is, so the trap above applies to it identically.

> **`crl_file` does not cover the CA named beside it.** An operator who has
> carefully wired up a `crl_file` will reasonably assume it covers the issuer in
> the same block. It does not: it covers what that CA **issued**, never that CA

> the chain to attest for it. So **revoking a trusted domain is an operator
> action** — remove or replace the `client_ca` entry and roll — and no CRL you
> can put in that file will do it for you.

This is also why the two features do not share a delivery path, despite both
being "a file of CRLs". `crl_chain_file` publishes ancestors' CRLs outbound and
accepts only CRLs signed by a certificate in this CA's own bundle;
`client_ca[].crl_file` is a separate inbound mechanism, verified per entry
against that entry's own anchors. Neither file can stand in for the other, and
adding an issuer to one has no effect on the other.

**5. Write the entry, and grant deliberately.** Both foreign grants default to
off, so an entry with neither adds an issuer that can authenticate and do
nothing:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: server-ca-trust
    secret:
      secretName: openvox-ca-server-ca-trust
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: server-ca-trust
    mountPath: /run/secrets/server-ca
    readOnly: true

config:
  client_ca:
    - name: server-ca                                       # required, unique; the metric and log label
      file: /run/secrets/server-ca/server-ca.pem            # the ISSUING CA, not the root
      crl_file: /run/secrets/server-ca/server-ca-crls.pem   # mandatory under `require`
      admin_cns:
        - openvox-server.example.com
      allow_pp_cli_auth: false
  client_revocation_policy: require
  client_crl_refresh_interval_sec: 900
```

Choose `name` for the operator who will meet it in an alert: it is the
`client_ca` label on `puppetca_client_crl_usable`,
`puppetca_client_crl_refusals_total` and
`puppetca_client_crl_last_reload_timestamp_seconds`, and the `client_ca` field
on every log line about the entry. Startup refuses a duplicate.

`allow_pp_cli_auth: true` **delegates admin admission to that CA** — every
certificate it chooses to stamp with the extension becomes an administrator
here. Correct for a Server CA under the same operators; a full delegation for a
CA you do not control. Enabling it warns at startup.

**6. Keep the CRL current.** Refresh the Secret by whatever already delivers it;
each entry's `crl_file` is re-read every `client_crl_refresh_interval_sec` (an
hour by default) and openvox-ca only notices. Not every reload is applied: four
conditions make one untrustworthy enough to refuse, and [the revocation
section](configuration.md#revocation) lists them. What matters here is the shape
they share — the previous set is kept, which is right for availability and
invisible on every other series, because the retained CRLs are still being
served. The signal is `puppetca_client_crl_last_reload_timestamp_seconds` going
stale, which `PuppetCAClientCRLStale` alerts on. Alert on `PuppetCAClientCRLUnusable` and
`PuppetCAClientCRLRefusals` too: under `require` an entry with no current CRL
rejects every one of its clients, and the first symptom is otherwise an
agent-side 403 three layers away.

#### Two failure modes specific to the chart

**A bad `crl_file` is a crash-loop, not a warning.** Under *every* policy the
server refuses to start when a `crl_file` that is set cannot be read or holds a
CRL that does not parse, and under `require` configuration validation rejects an
entry without one at all. In Kubernetes that is `CrashLoopBackOff` on a rollout
that looked routine. Render the values and check the paths against the mounts
before you apply — `helm template` shows both the `config.yaml` and the pod's
`volumeMounts`.

**Editing the anchor Secret in place does nothing.** Anchors are read once at
startup and deliberately never reload, because a half-applied anchor reload
locks out every client of a domain. A Secret's contents changing does not roll
the pods either — `configChecksumAnnotation` hashes the ConfigMap the chart
renders, not Secrets you mount yourself — so the new anchor sits on disk,
unread, until something else restarts the pod, and the old one goes on being
trusted. Nothing reports this.

To rotate an anchor, use the supported procedure: **add the new anchor as a
second `client_ca` entry, roll the fleet, then remove the old entry and roll
again.** Both halves are `config` changes, so on a default install each `helm
upgrade` moves the checksum annotation and rolls the pods for you. Changing
`admin_cns` is a restart-shaped change for the same reason, and gets the same
treatment — only domain zero's own admin allow list is reloadable through
`SIGHUP`.

> **Confirm the pods actually rolled before you treat the old anchor as
> untrusted.** The annotation is rendered only when `configChecksumAnnotation`
> is true *and* `existingConfigMap` is unset, and both of those are supported
> configurations. With either in play the `helm upgrade` that removes an entry

> withdrawal as complete only once they have.

## OpenBao CA key custody

Keeping the CA private key in an OpenBao Transit engine (see
[OpenBao Transit-engine CA key](openbao-transit.md)) is config plus, for the
non-Kubernetes auth methods, a mounted Secret:

```yaml
config:
  ca_key_provider: openbao
  openbao:
    addr: https://openbao.example.com:8200
    transit_mount: transit
    key_name: openvox-ca
    auth_method: kubernetes
    kubernetes_role: openvox-ca
```

If you also pin the CA *certificate* to a Secret, note that the `ca` block sets
both `ca_cert_file` and `ca_key_file`, and under this provider there is no key
file to point at. Clear that one explicitly — the empty string survives the
merge, and the server treats an empty `ca_key_file` as unset:

```yaml
ca:
  existingSecret: openvox-ca-cert   # certificate only
config:
  ca_key_provider: openbao
  ca_key_file: ""
```

With `auth_method: kubernetes` the pod authenticates with its own projected
ServiceAccount token — the chart detects this and mounts the token for you, so
there is nothing else to configure. For `approle` or `token`, mount the
credential files and point at them:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: openbao-approle
    secret:
      secretName: openvox-ca-openbao
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: openbao-approle
    mountPath: /run/secrets/openbao
    readOnly: true

config:
  openbao:
    auth_method: approle
    approle_role_id_file: /run/secrets/openbao/role_id
    approle_secret_id_file: /run/secrets/openbao/secret_id
```

## Bringing your own objects

Several escape hatches exist for things the chart does not model:

| Value | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `existingConfigMap` | A `config.yaml` you generate elsewhere |
| `persistence.existingClaim` | A PVC you provision yourself |
| `serviceAccount.create: false` + `serviceAccount.name` | An account managed outside the release |
| `extraVolumes` / `extraVolumeMounts` | etcd/Redis/SQL client certificates, passphrase files, autosign plugins, an upstream CRL chain or a `client_ca` anchor and its CRL (see [trust and revocation across CAs](#trust-and-revocation-across-cas)) |
| `initContainers` / `extraContainers` | Waiting on a dependency, sidecars |
| `command` / `args` | Full control of the container's invocation |
| `extraObjects` | Arbitrary manifests rendered with the release |

`extraVolumes`, `initContainers`, `extraContainers`, `extraObjects` and the
ingress and route fields are all run through `tpl`, so they can reference
`.Values` and the chart's helpers:

```yaml
extraObjects:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: '{{ include "openvox-ca.fullname" . }}-extra'
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      note: templated
```

## Upgrading

Chart and application versions move together, so upgrading the chart upgrades
openvox-ca:

```console
$ helm upgrade openvox-ca \
    oci://ghcr.io/voxpupuli/openvox-ca-charts/openvox-ca \
    --version X.Y.Z --namespace puppet --reset-then-reuse-values
```

`--reset-then-reuse-values` rather than `--reuse-values`: the latter rebuilds
the previous release's values by coalescing your overrides with *the chart
version you installed from*, and lays that over the upgrade, so a default the
new chart changed is masked by the old chart's copy of it and never takes
effect. `--reset-then-reuse-values` starts from the new chart's defaults and
reapplies your overrides on top, which is almost always what an upgrade is for.
Pass `-f values.yaml` instead if you keep your values in a file.

Worth knowing before you upgrade:

- While `persistence.enabled` is true the derived strategy is Recreate, so
  there is a brief outage as the old pod releases the volume. External-backend
  deployments (`persistence.enabled: false`) derive RollingUpdate and roll
  without one. To keep Recreate there, set `strategy: {type: Recreate}`
  explicitly.
- **Upgrading a SQL-backed deployment that is on RollingUpdate, across the
  advisory-lock change**, needs `strategy: {type: Recreate}` for that one
  upgrade, or a scale to zero and back. The PostgreSQL/MySQL lock-key
  derivation changed, so old and new pods do not exclude one another while
  both are running — and because the derived RollingUpdate sets
  `maxUnavailable: 0`, it surges the new pod alongside the old one even at
  `replicaCount: 1`. One replica is not enough to avoid this. If you take the
  `strategy` route, clear it again afterwards — remove the key from your
  values file, or `--set strategy=null` — because
  `--reset-then-reuse-values` reapplies your overrides on every later
  upgrade, so a pin set once keeps costing you the Recreate outage the bullet
  above says you had escaped. Scaling to zero and back leaves no such
  residue. See the note in
  [storage backends](storage-backends.md#sql-backends).
- The pods carry a checksum of the rendered config, so a change to `config`
  restarts them even though the Deployment's pod template is otherwise
  unchanged. Set `configChecksumAnnotation: false` if you would rather manage
  restarts yourself (with Reloader, say).
- **`existingConfigMap` turns that off**, necessarily: the chart cannot
  checksum a ConfigMap it did not render. openvox-ca does not re-read
  `config.yaml`, so editing your own ConfigMap leaves the running pods on the
  old config until you restart them — `kubectl rollout restart`, or an
  annotation-based reloader watching that ConfigMap. There is one exception, and
  it is narrower than it looks: *if your own config.yaml sets
  `puppet_server_file`* at a path in that ConfigMap, that file is re-read on
  `SIGHUP` (see
  [reloading configuration](configuration.md#reloading-configuration)) — the
  chart renders neither the file nor the setting in this mode, so it depends
  entirely on your config. Even then a signal only withdraws CNs that came from
  the file: one listed in `puppet_server` is frozen at startup, and a certificate
  carrying `pp_cli_auth` is an admin regardless of the allow list.

## Uninstalling

```console
$ helm uninstall openvox-ca --namespace puppet
```

The PersistentVolumeClaim **survives** by default, because it holds the CA's
private key. Remove it deliberately:

```console
$ kubectl delete pvc openvox-ca --namespace puppet
```

Objects created by [Kubernetes export](kubernetes-export.md) also survive —
openvox-ca does not delete what it exported. They carry
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=openvox-ca` — and *only* that: the exporter sets no
per-release label, so the selector cannot tell one CA's exports from another's.
Find them cluster-wide, but delete by namespace:

```console
$ kubectl get secret,configmap -A -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=openvox-ca
$ kubectl delete secret,configmap --namespace puppet \
    -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=openvox-ca
```

If you run more than one openvox-ca and export into shared namespaces, add a
label of your own under `kubernetesExport.targets[].metadata.labels` and select
on that as well — otherwise a cluster-wide delete takes the other CA's
certificate and CRL with it.
