# Development documentation

Documentation for people working **on** OpenVox CA, as opposed to deploying it.
If you are deploying OpenVox CA, start with the [README](../../README.md) and the
user-facing [docs](../).

Start here: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to build, test, and
submit changes, and [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for the authoritative
repository conventions (testing framework, compatibility contracts, commit
style).

## Contents
