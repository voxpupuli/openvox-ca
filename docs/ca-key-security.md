# CA key security

This page covers how the CA private key is protected at rest, the options for
moving key custody off the CA host entirely, and the detective control that
watches for anomalous destructive operations.

## CA key encryption at rest

By default, the CA private key is stored as unencrypted PEM at `<cadir>/private/ca_key.pem`.
Enable `--encrypt-ca-key` to encrypt the key at rest using AES-256-GCM with an Argon2id-derived key.

### How it works

- The private key is marshalled to PKCS#8 DER, then encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- The encryption key is derived from a passphrase using Argon2id (time=3, memory=64 MiB, threads=4).
- The encrypted key is stored as a PEM block with type `ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY`.
- On startup, the key is decrypted into memory and used for all signing operations.

### Passphrase resolution order

1. **`--ca-key-passphrase-file`:** reads the first line of the specified file.
2. **`PUPPET_CA_KEY_PASSPHRASE`** environment variable: avoids CLI `/proc/cmdline` exposure.
3. **Auto-generated:** if no passphrase source is configured, a cryptographically random
   passphrase is generated and saved to `<cadir>/private/.ca_key_passphrase` (mode `0600`).
   The path is logged at startup so operators know where it is.

### Example usage

```bash
# Bootstrap with encryption (auto-generated passphrase):
openvox-ca --cadir /var/lib/puppet-ca --encrypt-ca-key

# Bootstrap with an explicit passphrase file:
echo "my-secret-passphrase" > /etc/puppet-ca/key-passphrase
chmod 600 /etc/puppet-ca/key-passphrase
openvox-ca --cadir /var/lib/puppet-ca --encrypt-ca-key \
  --ca-key-passphrase-file /etc/puppet-ca/key-passphrase

# Or via environment variable:
export PUPPET_CA_KEY_PASSPHRASE="my-secret-passphrase"
openvox-ca --cadir /var/lib/puppet-ca --encrypt-ca-key

# openvox-ca-ctl setup also supports encryption:
openvox-ca-ctl setup --cadir /var/lib/puppet-ca --encrypt-ca-key
```

### Backward compatibility

Existing CAs with unencrypted keys continue to work without changes. The `--encrypt-ca-key`
flag only affects new CA bootstraps. Loading transparently handles both encrypted and
unencrypted PEM files.

### Security considerations

Encrypting the CA key at rest protects against **offline exfiltration**. If an attacker
obtains the key file from a backup, disk image, or volume snapshot, the key is unusable
without the passphrase. It does **not** protect against a live host compromise where the
attacker can read the passphrase source or dump the process memory.

For stronger protection, either delegate key custody to OpenBao entirely (available
today; see [OpenBao Transit-engine key custody](#openbao-transit-engine-key-custody)
below) or consider a hardware security module (HSM) via PKCS#11 (planned; see
[Planned: PKCS#11 / HSM support](#planned-pkcs11--hsm-support) below).

## The serving private key

When `tls_self_provision` is enabled the CA also holds a **serving** private
key — the one its own HTTPS listener presents. It lives in the storage backend
as `serving_key`, alongside `ca_key`, and `tls_self_provision_encrypt_key`
encrypts it at rest using exactly the machinery described above.

**It applies to the next key the CA issues, not to the one already stored.**
Like `--encrypt-ca-key`, the setting is read when a key is written, and the
serving key is only ever rewritten by a reissue. Turning it on and restarting
therefore changes nothing: the existing plaintext key parses fine, the
certificate is still usable, and it is reused. On default settings the next
reissue is up to two thirds of the leaf validity away — years. To apply it now, force a
reissue by revoking the serving certificate, and read the
warning under [Renewal](configuration.md#renewal) first: doing that on a live CA
interrupts every client that checks revocation until the next maintenance pass
mints the replacement.

Two things are worth stating plainly:

- With encryption off and a SQL backend, that key is stored in your database in
  plaintext. **Whether that is a new exposure depends on where your CA key
  lives**, and the two cases are genuinely different:
  - **CA key in the backend** (the default, `ca_key_provider: file` with no
    `ca_key_file`): this is the same posture `ca_key` already has, since
    `encrypt_ca_key` is off unless enabled. An operator who accepted it for the
    CA key has already made this decision; it is one blob over.
  - **CA key held elsewhere** — `ca_key_provider: openbao`, an external signer,
    or pinned to local disk with `ca_key_file` — your backend holds **no private
    key at all** today. Enabling `tls_self_provision` puts one there, and that
    *is* a new class of exposure. `ca_key_file` does not help: it pins only the
    CA key, and there is no equivalent for the serving key. Set
    `tls_self_provision_encrypt_key` (with an explicit passphrase — see below),
    which is the protection available here.

  This matters because holding the CA key at a provider is one of the reasons
  this feature exists: cert-manager cannot act as a CA issuer without the key.
- The serving key is far less valuable than the CA key. It authenticates one
  host for one hostname and can be replaced at will — revoke the CA's own
  hostname and the next maintenance pass issues a new one. Compromising the CA
  key means reissuing every certificate in the fleet.

`tls_self_provision_encrypt_key` requires an explicit passphrase source; it
refuses the auto-generated one, because that passphrase is written into `cadir`
and replicas with an ephemeral `cadir` could not read each other's key. See
[configuration](configuration.md#self-provisioned-serving-certificate).

## OpenBao Transit-engine key custody

`--ca-key-provider openbao` delegates the CA private key entirely to an
[OpenBao](https://openbao.org/) Transit secrets engine key: the key never exists inside
any `openvox-ca` process at all, on disk or in memory — only a digest crosses the wire
to be signed. This works identically whether `openvox-ca` runs as a plain systemd
service (AppRole or a static token file) or as a Kubernetes pod authenticating via its
own ServiceAccount (Kubernetes auth) — with no Vault/OpenBao Agent sidecar required:
`openvox-ca` maintains its own OpenBao token lifecycle, proactively renewing it and
re-authenticating from source credentials whenever renewal fails.

Every existing storage backend keeps working unmodified in this mode — OpenBao only
ever supplants key custody, never CSR/certificate/CRL/inventory storage. See
[OpenBao Transit-engine CA key](openbao-transit.md) for full configuration
reference and setup instructions.

This integration is built and tested against OpenBao specifically, against current
OpenBao releases. It should also work against HashiCorp Vault, since Vault's Transit
engine, AppRole/Kubernetes auth methods, and Go client API are what OpenBao forked from
and remains wire-compatible with — but Vault is not part of the test matrix, so this is
currently unverified. Compatibility bug reports (and fixes) for Vault are welcome.

## Planned: PKCS#11 / HSM support

A future enhancement will add PKCS#11 support so the CA private key can be held in a
hardware security module (HSM), TPM, or software token (e.g. SoftHSM2). The key would
never leave the token; only signing operations would be delegated via the PKCS#11 API.
It would slot in as a third `--ca-key-provider` value, alongside `file` (default) and
`openbao`.

**Planned design:**

- `--ca-key-provider pkcs11`: a PKCS#11 module URI or library path, slot/token label, and PIN
  (via file or env var, same pattern as `--ca-key-passphrase-file`)
- Integration with **p11-kit** for module discovery, allowing operators to configure the
  PKCS#11 backend (SoftHSM2, TPM2 PKCS#11, cloud KMS bridges, Nitrokey, YubiHSM, etc.)
  via the system p11-kit configuration rather than hardcoding library paths
- CGo dependency for the PKCS#11 C bindings (build-time opt-in)

This is tracked as a separate feature. Contributions welcome.

## Monitoring destructive operations

The server tracks the rate of destructive operations (certificate revocation and
deletion) per authenticated client. When a single client exceeds **5 destructive
operations per minute**, a warning is emitted to the structured log:

```text
level=WARN msg="High rate of destructive operations detected" client=admin.example.com operation=revoke
```

This is a detective control, not a preventive one. It does not block the operation, but alerts
operators to potentially anomalous administrative activity. Operators should:

- Forward `openvox-ca` logs to a centralized log aggregator (e.g. Loki,
  Elasticsearch, Splunk)
- Create alerts on `"High rate of destructive operations"` log messages
- Investigate any alerts promptly. A burst of revocations may indicate a
  compromised admin certificate or an operational error
- Consider whether the `--puppet-server` allow list should be tightened if
  unexpected clients appear in these warnings

The threshold (5 ops/minute) is a sensible default for environments where
bulk revocation is uncommon. Future versions may make this configurable.
