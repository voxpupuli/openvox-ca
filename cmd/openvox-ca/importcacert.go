The bundle must be a complete chain, ordered nearest-first: this CA's own
certificate, each issuer after it, ending with a self-signed root. No key
material need be supplied: the command proves the certificate binds whatever key
ca_key_provider holds, before writing anything. With the default file provider
that means reading the stored key (and decrypting it, if encrypt_ca_key is set);
with OpenBao Transit the key never leaves the vault and only its public
component is compared.

for deployments where the CA certificate is mounted read-only from outside
(a Kubernetes Secret, for example).`,
