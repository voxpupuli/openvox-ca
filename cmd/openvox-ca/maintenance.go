// maintenanceTask is one unit of periodic upkeep. Each is individually gated,
// and the loop runs whenever any of them is enabled.
//
// The loop is named for itself rather than for its first tenant, and that is
// not cosmetic. The obvious alternatives both have the same bug in different
// clothes: folding these into runCRLRefresher means disable_crl_refresh
// silently disables serving-certificate renewal too, and gating the goroutine
// on tls_self_provision means a deployment that supplies its certificate from a
// Secret never runs any of the other tasks. Naming an interval after one
// feature is what makes gating it on that feature look reasonable.

// were down is picked up without waiting a full interval.

// loop and never stops its siblings. Startup is where a failure is fatal —
// there is no certificate to fall back on — whereas here there is one already
// in place, and the renewal window leaves roughly a third of the leaf lifetime
// of runway for a transient storage outage to clear.
