"integrity check failed". While the stored value does not verify, every read
path is fail-closed: revocation fails for every subject, so credentials cannot
even be retired while the cause is investigated.

This does not verify or repair the inventory. It re-asserts integrity over
whatever the inventory now contains, so any tampering present is signed over and
becomes valid. Establish why verification failed before running it.
