// The store-wide instance lock, which permits exactly one running instance on a
// backend that cannot coordinate several.
//
// A backend with proper distributed locking may run multiple instances, on one
// host or on many; every other backend permits exactly one. The rule is a
// property of the backend's locking rather than of its name, so this gates on
// StorageService.SupportsDistributedLocking and a backend that gains or loses
// that capability gets the right behaviour without anyone remembering to update
// a list.
//
// Why exclusion rather than finer-grained locking. Each ca.CA holds state no
// other process sees or invalidates — the serial index, the OCSP cache, and the
// CRL its own revocation checks read. A second instance issues certificates the
// first never learns of, and a revocation performed on one leaves the other
// still authenticating the revoked certificate. Making individual writes atomic
// would correct what lands on disk and none of that; reconciling cached state
// across processes is what the distributed backends do through shared storage,
// and the single-node backends have no such mechanism by design.
//
// This is the same flock(2) primitive as the per-name same-host locks in
// filelock.go, at a different granularity: one lock for the whole store, held
// for the lifetime of the process rather than for one operation.
//
// It is deliberately best-effort, and cannot be otherwise. An advisory lock says
// nothing useful over NFS, and a second process on another host cannot be
// excluded at all — which is why the documentation half of this rule cannot be
// replaced by the code half. See docs/storage-backends.md.

// instanceLockName is the reserved lock naming the store as a whole.
//
// It sits outside every namespace real operations use ("bootstrap", "crl",
// "subject:<name>") and outside lockProbeName, so nothing an instance does
// while running can contend with the lock proving it is the only instance.
const instanceLockName = "store-instance"

// instanceProbeTimeout bounds the SupportsDistributedLocking probe that decides
// whether the instance lock applies at all.
//
// Bounded here rather than left to callers because forgetting it converts a
// safety check into an outage: the probe takes and releases a real lock, so on
// an unreachable cluster backend an unbounded one would hang startup for ever
// instead of failing. A caller's own deadline still applies if it is shorter.
//
// A variable rather than a constant so a spec can drive the bound itself, in the
// same way and for the same reason tryLock is indirected in filelock.go: the
// property worth pinning is that a probe which never returns cannot hang a
// startup, and a ten-second wait is not something a unit suite can sit through.
// Production never changes it.
var instanceProbeTimeout = 10 * time.Second

// instanceHolderLimit caps how much of a lock file is read back when reporting
// who holds it. The record is one short line; anything longer is not ours.
const instanceHolderLimit = 512

// StoreLockedError reports that another process already holds the store's
// instance lock, and names it. Holder is what that process recorded about
// itself, and is empty when the record could not be read.

//
// Deliberately not part of Backend: a backend that cannot provide one is not
// broken, it is simply one where this rule has to rest on the operator instead.
//
// No context parameter, unlike Locker and SameHostLocker, and that is the
// contract rather than an oversight: this acquisition never waits. A caller
// starting a server wants to be told that another instance is running, not to
// queue behind it until a timeout it would then have to explain.
type InstanceLocker interface {
	AcquireInstanceLock() (Unlocker, error)
}

// AcquireInstanceLock takes the store-wide lock permitting exactly one running
// instance, and returns an Unlocker the caller must hold for as long as it is
// running.
//
// It reports StoreLockedError when another process already holds the store, and
// a nil error in every case where the rule does not apply or cannot be
// enforced. Those two are not the same answer and the caller must not conflate
// them: only the error means "do not run".
//
// The three no-op cases:
//
//   - The backend has distributed locking. Multiple instances are a supported,
//     designed-for configuration there, so there is nothing to enforce and this
//     must not interfere with it.
//   - The capability could not be determined. See below.
//   - The backend has no instance lock to take: an in-memory SQLite database
//     private to this process, a platform without flock(2), a store on a
//     read-only mount. Warned about, then allowed, because refusing to start
//     over a lock that is unavailable rather than held would take down a CA
//     that worked before this check existed.
//
// A caller that has already asked SupportsDistributedLocking may pass the
// answer with WithKnownDistributedLocking and skip the probe here; without it
// this method probes for itself, so it is always safe to call knowing nothing.
//
// # Releasing it
//
// Release the lock AFTER closing the backend it protects, never before. Between
// the two, a second process that took the store would find this one still
// holding an open handle to it -- on SQLite a pooled connection to the very
// database file the lock exists to keep to one writer.
//
// The mechanism differs by caller because their lifetimes do, and neither can
// borrow the other's: `openvox-ca` hangs the release off a runtime whose closer
// list runs in reverse, so it inserts the release at the front
// (cmd/openvox-ca/runtime.go, holdInstanceLock); `openvox-ca-ctl` has no such
// list and returns one cleanup that does both in order
// (cmd/openvox-ca-ctl/migrate.go, lockStore). What they share is this rule and
// the spec helper that asserts it, testutil.RecordingBackend -- so the
// invariant is stated once here rather than argued twice there.
//
// On a probe error it warns and permits, which is the safe direction here even
// though it reads like the unsafe one. The error path is unreachable for the
// backends this rule governs: FilesystemBackend implements no Locker at all, so
// the probe answers (false, nil); SQLite implements one but reports
// ErrDistributedLockingUnsupported, likewise (false, nil); and an
// OverlayBackend over either returns the same sentinel. A non-nil error can
// therefore only come from a backend that does have distributed locking and is
// momentarily unreachable — where refusing to start would be a restriction on
// precisely the deployments this rule exempts, and where the process will fail
// loudly on its own first locked operation anyway if the backend is really down.
