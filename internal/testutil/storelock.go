// RecordingBackend notes the order in which a store is given back: its own
// Close, and the release of the store-wide instance lock through the unlocker
// it hands out.
//
// It exists for one assertion, made in two packages: the instance lock must be
// released *after* the backend it protects is closed, never before. Releasing
// first reopens the window the lock exists to close — another process may take
// a store this one still holds an open handle to, which on SQLite is a pooled
// connection to the database file itself. Both `openvox-ca` and
// `openvox-ca-ctl` reach that invariant through their own helper
// (`holdInstanceLock` and `lockStore` respectively), so both need to assert it
// and neither owns the other's.
//
// Only Close and AcquireInstanceLock are overridden; every other method comes
// from the embedded backend, so this records the ordering without altering what
// the store does.
