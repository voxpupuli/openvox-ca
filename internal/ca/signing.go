// decision made from an out-of-date CRL is self-limiting: it admits a revoked
// certificate for at most one sync interval, after which the same certificate
// is rejected. Renewal mints a *new* certificate — fresh serial, full leaf
// validity, every authorisation OID carried forward, and on the CSR path a key
// of the client's choosing — that no CRL will ever list, because the serial the

// lockout by years, which is not a window anyone would call 60 seconds.
