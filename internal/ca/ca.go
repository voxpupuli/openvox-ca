	RevokeOnAutoRenew bool

	// SupersedeAfter delays the revocation of a certificate a renewal has
	// replaced by this long, instead of revoking it in the renewal call. The
	// replaced serial is recorded on a durable, cross-subject list and a
	// periodic sweep (ReconcileSuperseded) revokes it once the delay elapses.
	//
	// Zero is the behaviour that predates the list: the replaced certificate is
	// revoked immediately, inside the renewal, and nothing is recorded. It is
	// this type's zero value, so a CA constructed without setting it — the
	// offline commands and openvox-ca-ctl — retires immediately, which is the
	// right default for a deliberate operator action at a terminal.
	//
	// It is *not* what the server does. `openvox-ca serve` sets this from
	// superseded_cert_revoke_after_sec, which defaults to 24h, so an ordinary
	// deployment grants a window. The two differ deliberately: a fleet renewing
	// on a timer needs the overlap, and an operator revoking by hand does not.
	//
	// A positive value is a deliberate weakening of that: for the length of the
	// window the replaced certificate — and, on the CSR-based re-key path, the
	// replaced *private key* — remains a credential this CA accepts. It buys
	// the overlap a fleet needs to pick up a replacement without a gap, which is
	// what makes a renewal safe to perform on a certificate other parties are
	// actively verifying. Set it no longer than that pickup takes.
	//
	// It applies to both renewal paths: the CSR-based Renew and, subject to
	// RevokeOnAutoRenew, AutoRenew. RevokeOnAutoRenew still decides whether
	// AutoRenew retires its predecessor at all; this decides when.

	//
	// The right size is a property of the deployment's signer: an in-process

	// Four counters, because their remedies differ: crlChainFailures points at
	// the file itself, crlChainDiscarded at the CA bundle, crlChainRegressed at
	// whatever writes the file, and crlChainRemoved at either the file or the
	// bundle, being the one with two causes. (The file's *mount* is a fifth
	// question, and it is crlChainLastRead below, a gauge rather than a counter,
	// because "never opened" is a state and not an event.)
	//
	// crlChainRemoved is the one with two causes, because it is named for an
	// outcome rather than a fault: an ancestor's CRL stops being published
	// either because the file stopped listing it, or because the ancestor's
	// certificate left the CA bundle and nothing signs its CRL any more. The
	// second points at the bundle, like crlChainDiscarded, so an incomplete
	// bundle can move both at once -- discarded for the file's copy, removed for
	// the published one. The log line names which fired.
	//
	// Three of the four are per *evaluation*, not per pass: crl_chain_file is
	// evaluated on every CRL amendment as well as on each refresh pass, so on a
	// busy CA they track revocation rate rather than the number of bad CRLs in
	// the file. crlChainFailures counts the whole file once per evaluation.
	// crlChainDiscarded and crlChainRegressed count once per CRL per evaluation.
	// All three describe what the file currently *holds*, which is a standing
	// condition worth re-counting for as long as it stands.
	//
	// crlChainRemoved is the exception, because it reports a transition rather
	// than a standing condition: an ancestor that is published and is about to
	// stop being. It deduplicates by *ancestor* -- its main arm keys on the
	// signing certificate, its bundle-attribution arm on the issuer DN, because
	// there is no signer left to key on -- and it counts only on the pass that
	// publishes. RefreshCRLChainFile evaluates twice per rewrite, once to decide
	// and once inside reissueCRLLocked to build what it publishes, and the
	// ancestor is still in the published chain both times; counting on both made
	// one lost ancestor read as 2. See upstreamPass in crlchainfile.go.
	//
	// Do not assume an ordering between them. An unreadable or unparseable file
	// increments crlChainFailures alone, because upstreamCRLs returns before the
	// per-CRL loops are reached.
	//
	// What an alert window can be sized against is the floor they share: a quiet
	// CA evaluates the file once per crl_chain_refresh_interval_sec. See
	// mixin/config.libsonnet, which says the same thing.
	//
	// crlChainFailures counts refresh passes that could not publish the upstream
	// chain at all -- unreadable, unparseable, truncated or oversized. The
	// published chain is left alone and the next pass retries.
	//
	// crlChainDiscarded counts CRLs dropped from crl_chain_file because nothing
	// in the CA bundle signed them. This is the case where the chain quietly
	// *shrinks*: the file is authoritative, so a CRL the operator put there and
	// this CA would not accept simply stops being published.
	//
	// crlChainRegressed counts CRLs in crl_chain_file that were older than the
	// one already published for the same ancestor, and so were not used -- see
	// monotonicUpstream. It is deliberately not folded into crlChainDiscarded:
	// the two have opposite remedies. A discard means the CA bundle is missing
	// an ancestor, so the operator checks the bundle; a regression means the
	// file itself is stale, rolled back or replayed, so the operator checks
	// whatever writes it. One counter would have sent a paged responder to
	// verify a bundle that was already complete.
	//
	// crlChainRemoved counts ancestors whose published CRL has been dropped from
	// the chain: either the file stopped listing them, or their certificate left
	// the CA bundle so nothing signs that CRL any more. Honoured rather than
	// refused, unrecoverable here, and a `cat` glob that matched one file fewer
	// produces the first just as readily as a deliberate removal does. It
	// overlaps crlChainDiscarded rather than being distinct from it: an
	// incomplete bundle moves both, discarded for the copy the file carries and
	// removed for the copy already published.
