// SECURITY: the subject-alternative-name policy is enforced in one place --
// checkSubjectAltNames, called from signWithDuration -- and its completeness
// rests entirely on a call-graph property: every path that turns a *submitted
// CSR* into a certificate goes through that function. Nothing in the type
// system says so. A new path that called issueLeafLocked directly, exactly as
// the generate paths legitimately do, would issue certificates carrying
// whatever names a request asked for, and every existing spec would stay green,
// because each one drives a caller that does pass through the gate.
//
// So the property is asserted here instead: issueLeafLocked has exactly the
// callers listed below and no others. Adding one is not forbidden -- it means
// answering, in review, which side of the boundary the new path sits on. The
// boundary is the CSR, not the caller: names arriving on a submitted request
// are gated, names an administrator supplies directly are not.
//
// This cannot use the compile-time bindings internal/api/authseam_test.go has,
// because issueLeafLocked is unexported and this file is package ca_test. A
// rename would leave the walk matching nothing -- which is why the assertion is
// an exact set comparison rather than a check that no unexpected caller exists:
// renaming the method empties the found set, and an empty set is not the
// expected one, so the spec fails and names what it could no longer find.
//
